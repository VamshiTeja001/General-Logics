1. These are verilog HDL files for design circuits commonly used in higher level circuits. Most of the codes are are designed in such as way that it can be scalable as they are parameterized module instantiated. Changing the widths within #() is auto adapt the design.
2. These modules vere defined and tested in AMD Vivado.
3. Basic STA verified.
